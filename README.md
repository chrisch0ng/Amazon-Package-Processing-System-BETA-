# Amazon-Package-Processing-System-BETA

# BETA System in Amazon Package Processing. I was initially wondering how the large company Amazon so easily
ensures that their packages are in the smallest boxes possible to be most effective for shipping, so I created
a simple program which does the basic calculations for finding the smallest box out of three primary 
box sizes which would fit a given package, when given its dimensions

Plan on Expanding on this further with an interface to input these dimensions, and calculate shipping and tax costs 
to Amazon for easy conveyance to the customer
